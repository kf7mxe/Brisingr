Could you write a script to generate synthetic training data for the wake word, specifically the positive data. In this case the positive data will be .wav recordings of the someone saying the word: BRISS-ing-ger. Pronounced BRIS-ing-gr, like "briss-ing-ger," with the first part rhyming with "Swiss," the "ing" like in "sing," and the "gr" ending with a soft 'er' sound (like "her"), similar to a quick "ger" or "grr". The 'i' is short (as in "it"), the 's' is sharp, the 'g' is hard (as in "go"), and the final 'r' is a soft 'uh' sound. 

Will this help improve the model's performance?. I have lots of negative or noise data but not allot of positive data.

The amount of battery the android WakeWordDetector.kt is using is allot, do you know of any way to reduce the battery usage? Also could you add debug info to figure out which part of the code is using the most battery.
